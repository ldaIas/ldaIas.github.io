        <h3>What is Summer Formal?</h3>
        <p>
            Summer Formal is a time for all of us to come together and have a great time outside of work. 
            It's like a group event, but planned by everyone and open to anyone. Most think of it as a
            "prom" in the summer. The Prom Comittee will find a date that would work best to allow the 
            most people to come. They will also find a venue and come up with fundraising ideas (venues
            aren't free unfortunately). 
        </p>
        <p>
            There will be a few dates before formal to fundraise or get items you bought from fundraisers.
            You can find these in the 'Fundraisers' tab or <a href="./fund.html">here</a>. 
        </p>
